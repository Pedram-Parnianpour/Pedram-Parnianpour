About Me

Hi! I'm Pedram Parnianpour, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia. My research focuses on neuroimaging, machine learning, and biomedical signal processing, with a specific interest in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and related disorders.

I hold a PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Alberta, where my doctoral research centered around using MRI-based techniques and texture analysis to explore cerebral degeneration and disease heterogeneity in ALS.

# Research Interests

- Neuroimaging (structural & functional MRI)
- ALS disease progression, stratification, and subtyping
- Machine learning & deep learning for medical imaging
- Biomarker development and predictive modelling

# Academic Highlights

- Delivered presentations at the International Symposium on ALS/MND, Organization for Human Brain Mapping, and Neuroimaging Society in ALS
- Co-authored publications in Brain Communications, Scientific Reports, Journal of Neurology, and more
- Collaborated with global academic leaders and industry partners like Biogen Inc.

# Teaching & Mentorship

Iâ€™ve taught and supported students in courses including Biomedical Instrumentation, Applied Linear Algebra, and Physics for Engineers, and supervised undergraduate research projects on brain imaging in ALS.
